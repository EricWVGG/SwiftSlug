# SwiftSlug

SwiftSlug is a simple package to convert strings to URL slugs. A "slug" is the address of a page on your website, which for SEO reasons is often created using the title of your page. SwiftSlug is responsible for converting a string such as "Hello, world!" into "hello-world" so it's safe to use in a URL.

SwiftSlug works on both macOS and Linux, although it operates quite differently on both platforms due to API limitations. On macOS, SwiftSlug uses an ICU transform so that all UTF-8 characters are correctly transliterated into Latin letters, but on Linux this approach is not available so it does a lossy ASCII conversion instead.

**If you can think of any way to improve cross-platform transliteration, pull requests are most welcome!**


## Usage

SwiftSlug adds a `convertedToSlug()` method on Swift's `String` type, which returns `String?`: a string if the conversion was successful or `nil` otherwise. For example, this will print "hello-world":

```swift
if let slug = try? "Hello, world".convertedToSlug() {
    print(slug)
}
```

The method will throw `SlugConversionError.failedToConvert` if transliteration could not take place for some reason, or if the resulting slug had zero characters.

**Note:** On macOS, SwiftSlug uses APIs that were introduced in El Capitan, so you should add an availability check if needed:

```swift
if #available(OSX 10.11, *) {
    if let slug = try? "Hello, world".convertedToSlug() {
        print(slug)
    }
}
```


## Examples

```swift
if #available(OSX 10.11, *) {
    if let slug1 = try? "Hello, world".convertedToSlug() {
        print(slug1)
    } else {
        print("slug1 could not be converted.")
    }

    if let slug2 = try? "!@$%^Hello, world!:|~?><".convertedToSlug() {
        print(slug2)
    } else {
        print("slug2 could not be converted.")
    }

    if let slug3 = try? "吃葡萄不吐葡萄皮".convertedToSlug() {
        print(slug3)
    } else {
        print("slug3 could not be converted.")
    }
}
```


Output on macOS:

> hello-world

> hello-world

> chi-pu-tao-bu-tu-pu-tao-pi

Output on Linux:

> hello-world

> hello-world

> slug3 could not be converted.

Linux fails to convert `slug3` because it contains no characters that can be reduced to ASCII even with lossy conversion.
